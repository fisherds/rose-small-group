              <b>What</b>: A “Small Group” is a group of people that meet weekly to talk about life from a Christian
              perspective.
              Specifically, in this group, we will be discussing one chapter per week of the book “The Story”. Everyone
              that
              joins will get a book, which is free for students and only $5 for faculty and staff.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <b>Who</b>: Anyone, Christian or non-Christian, students, faculty, or staff, that has interest is learning
              more about
              what is in the bible. It can be difficult to read the whole bible, but The Story is an abridged bible that
              is
              much easier to read because it is written in a narrative form. With the help of others, you can be
              successful
              in reading all of the stories in the bible!
